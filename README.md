## Polo Timer
Welcome to my Polo Timer project. This simple Python-based tool was created for time keeping and score keeping polo matches. The intention was touse the project as a hands-on exercise for me to learn the basics of Python. I enjoyed building it and I hope it's the first project of many.

## Disclaimer
This project is a personal learning exercise. You might find that the code isn’t as neat or optimized as production-level software, but it works. Feel free to use, modify, or enhance it according to your needs.

## Features
Basic Timer Functionality: Start, stop, and reset the timer.
Simple, Direct Code: Built with beginners in mind.
Customizable: Open for improvements and modifications.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter

## Installation
To clone the repository, open your terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/cam01h/polo-timer.git

Navigate to the Project Folder:
cd polo-timer

Run the Script:
python polo_timer.py

## Instructions
Once you run the script, fill in the team names, player names and number of chukkas then click start game. 

The Start/Stop and +/-5secs butons are used to control the game clock. The timer will turn red when the chukka enters its final 30 seconds. When the chukka is over, click the button to change to the next chukka so that its reflected in the game log.

Left click the player names to record a goal in the tally next to their name and in the game log. A right click removes a goal so errors can be corrected and the game log is a fillable notepad so errors can be manually corrected in there. Feel free to record any other notable event in the game log, it wont affect the automations resulting from the clickable lables

## Future Development Prospects
There are two issues regarding funtionality that i am currently aware of:
1. There is no way to record handicap goals
2. There is no way to record penalty goals
I will have a look at these in time and hopefully I can make some cosmetic changes.

## Contributing
Though i imagine the ven diagramme of people who code and people who timekeep polo matches is a very small intersection, contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions, improvements, etc. please fork the repository and submit a pull request or email me @ cam01houston@gmail.com
